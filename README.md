# Back-End
You need to clone the project and locate to back-end folder.
If you are located correctly, run "npm i" (this command is for the node modules)
Then run "nodemon app.js" (This command will open rest api in localhost)
Please make sure that PORT number is 8080.Port number is crucial for the end points. (You can find out it in app.js file)
Dont worry about the database configuration because it is already deployed to heroku.(with clearDB)
